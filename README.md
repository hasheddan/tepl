## Design Checklist

This is an informal, early stage checklist of ideas proposed by [@hasheddan](https://github.com/hasheddan) and slightly modified by [@nickgerace](https://github.com/nickgerace).

- [ ] use twitter as a collaborative "IDE"
- [ ] design a language that can be expressed very minimally (due to 280 char limit)
- [ ] build a small VM to host the "IDE"
- [ ] people can write tweets and tag the account
- [ ] host a service that executes the program in the tweet and posts the output in a response
- [ ] super fun stretch goal: tweets could also serve as modules (enables referencing another tweet and importing it to include in your program)

While seemingly purposeless, the fun stems from super constrained tweets that could get really creative with interesting programs.
